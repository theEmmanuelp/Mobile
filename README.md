BLABOOT

Project Overview:

Blaboot is a quiz app where users can create and share quizzes with friends or colleagues. Blaboot is designed for those interested in making fun quizzes for themselves or others, within an easily accessible app on their mobile devices. Users are encouraged to rate the best quizzes through a rating system similar to those seen on other applications. Unlike competitors Blaboot strives for personal improvements instead of challenging friends and colleagues.

As a knowledgeable quiz taker I want to be able to easily search for a quiz I want to take.
As a curious user I want to be able to browse for a quiz when I don’t have one in mind.
As an excited user I want the ability to follow other user’s profile pages.
As a fan I want the ability to view other user’s profiles along with their created quizzes
As a perfectionist test taker I wish to view my recent activities on the home page.
As the creative quiz creator I want the interface of creation to be easily understood, as well as nice to look at.
As a smart quiz creator I want the questions on quizzes to be randomized to remove any cognitive or implicit biases.
